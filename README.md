# ✉️ Email Extractor — Python Automation Script

> ⚙️ Created as part of my Python internship with [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech) — **Task 3: Task Automation**  
> A small script with a big purpose: Extract email addresses from raw text using Python and regex!

## 💡 What This Project Does

Have a messy `.txt` file full of text and buried emails?  
This script helps you:

- 🧹 Clean the text
- 🔍 Find all email addresses using regular expressions
- 📄 Save them to a clean `.txt` file — ready to use!

It’s a quick automation tool that saves time and effort in data collection tasks.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Automatically extracts emails from text  
✅ Uses Python's built-in `re` module  
✅ Handles file reading and writing with ease  
✅ Beginner-friendly, human-readable code  
✅ Saves the final list in a new `.txt` file

## 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used

- 🐍 Python 3
- 🔎 Regular Expressions (`re`)
- 📁 File Handling (Read/Write)
- 🔃 Automation
- ✅ Input Validation (basic)

## 🧾 How It Works

```python
# You provide an input file (e.g., sample.txt)
# The script scans the text using regex
# It writes all found email addresses to emails.txt
```

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A `.txt` file with email-like text (e.g., `sample.txt`)

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the script file into a `.py` file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sangeetha-K-04/Codealpha-Task3.git
   cd Codealpha-Task3
2. Edit the file paths in the script to point to your local files:
- input_file = "C:/path/to/sample.txt"
- output_file = "C:/path/to/emails.txt"
3. Run the script in the terminal:
  ```bash
python email_extractor.py
